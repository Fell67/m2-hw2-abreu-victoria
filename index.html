                    <h2 id="ski-passes">Colorado Season Passes</h2>
                    <p>
                        While each resort has its own ski passes if you are planning on going to a few resorts or staying in Colorado for an extended period of time consider getting a season pass. Season passes tend to pay for themselves after a few days of being on the slopes (Colorado Ski Resort Lift Ticket Prices and Rates, n.d.). Season Pass holders that buy their pass early tend to get the best lift ticket price and extra benefits depending on the pass (Colorado Ski Resort Lift Ticket Prices and Rates, n.d.).
                    </p>
                    <h3>Epic Pass</h3>
                    <p>
                        Vail Resorts created the Epic Pass (Altschul, 2023). Epic offers a wide variety of passes from full access to all of their resorts with no blackout days to specific resort passes that have some blackout days (2025). They offer access to resorts not only in Colorado but also at their partner resorts located around the world (2025). To see up to date information about the passes that they are currently offering go to
                        <a href="https://www.epicpass.com/pass-results/passes.aspx">their website</a>
                        (2025).
                        <br/>
                        In Colorado they offer access to the following resorts (Altschul, 2023):
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Vail</li>
                        <li>Breckenridge</li>
                        <li>Beaver Creek</li>
                        <li>Keystone</li>
                        <li>Crested Butte</li>
                        <li>Telluride</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Ikon Pass</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Ikon Pass was created by the Alterra Mountain Company which is a group of 18 ski resorts (Cassidy, 2023). Just like the Epic pass the Ikon Pass offers a variety of passes ranging from full access to all of their resorts with no blackout dates to cheaper passes (Https://Www.ikonpass.com/En/Shop-Passes, n.d.). To see up to date information about the passes they are currently offering go to
                        <a href="https://www.ikonpass.com/en/shop-passes">their website</a>
                        (Https://Www.ikonpass.com/En/Shop-Passes, n.d.).
                        <br/>
                        In Colorado they offer access to the following resorts (Ikon Pass, 2022):
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Steamboat</li>
                        <li>Winter Park Resort</li>
                        <li>Copper Mountain Resort</li>
                        <li>Arapahoe Basin</li>
                        <li>Aspen Snowmass</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Mountain Collective</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Mountain Collective is a group of ski resorts in the U.S. and internationally and was created as an alternate to the Epic Pass (Altschul, 2024). They only offer one pass with no blackout days (Multi Resort Ski Pass | Mountain Collective Season Ski Passes, n.d.). To see up to date information about the pass go to
                        <a href="https://mountaincollective.com/">their website</a>
                        (Multi Resort Ski Pass | Mountain Collective Season Ski Passes, n.d.).
                        <br/>
                        In Colorado they offer access to the following resorts (Multi Resort Ski Pass | Mountain Collective Season Ski Passes, n.d.):
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Aspen Snowmass</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Note: The Mountain Collective and Ikon Pass have some of the same resorts (ie Aspen Snowmass) (Altschul, 2024).
                    </p>
                    <h3>Indy Pass</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Indy Pass was launched by Doug Fish, owner of Fish Marketing in Oregon, as a less expensive alternative to other ski passes (Altschul, 2025). Just like the Epic pass and Ikon Pass it offers a few different passes ranging from ones with no blackout dates to cheaper passes (Your Ticket to Independent Resorts, 2017). To see up to date information about the pass go to
                        <a href="https://www.indyskipass.com/shop">their website</a>
