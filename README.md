## Assignment
In this assignment you will create a basic single page website. This will help you become familiar with using both Semantic and non-semantic HTML to create webpages.

### Setup
Create a git repository titled m2-hw2-lastname-firstname and clone the repo to your computer.

### Instructions
Create a single webpage about your favorite hobby. Please keep all of the content professional and appropriate for the academic setting. To receive full-credit, please utilize the following on your website:
1. A single h1 tag
1. Subsequent headings use h2 tags (Use h3-h6 as subheadings when necessary)
1. Use the header, main, and footer tags to organize content.
1. Use section tags to divide the page into sections as necessary (tips, intro, etc.)
1. At least one ordered or unordered list
1. At least one working link to an external webpage.
1. At least one image. Please keep your image size small. Use squoosh.appLinks to resize images as necessary.
1. A nav element in the header that uses relative links to link to various sections of the page.
1. Place all blocks of text in paragraph tags. Blocks of text that can be understood on their own outside of the site should be grouped into article tags.

### Deployment
Your code must be deployed to GitHub Pages. To deploy a repository to GitHub pages you must:
1. Ensure your repository has an index.html file in the root directory.
1. Navigate to the settings section of the repository.
1. Click on pages in the left navigation menu.
1. Under source click the dropdown and select your master or main branch.
1. Click save.

Your site should be deployed to `<your github username>`.github.io/`<your repository name>` in 5-10 minutes.
